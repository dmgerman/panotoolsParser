USAGE:

This bison/yacc parser implements a simple parser that reads a file
and converts it into an equivalent data structure. The main function
to use is:


pt_script *panoParseScript(char *filename)


It returns an allocated data structure pt_script. It should be
disposed properly using panoParseDispose.


void panoParseDispose(pt_script **scriptVar)


----------------------------------------------------------------------
TODO:

* Add support for K and V variables in hugin

* Create a bunch of test cases

* Create an include file for internal use, and one for exports. 

* Add support for en error function pointer so it can be replaced

* Refactor the code to  dump the data structure into a function that
  can be used for debugging/testing

* We need a function to verify that the read values are meaningful but
  perhaps that is outside the scope of the parser.
